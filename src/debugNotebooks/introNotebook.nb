# Introducing Starboard Notebook
Starboard brings cell-by-cell notebooks to the browser, no code is running on the backend here!  
It's probably the quickest way to visualize some data with interactivity, do some prototyping, or build a rudimentary dashboard.

#### Some features 
* Mix Markdown, HTML, CSS, $\LaTeX$, Python, and Javascript.
* The file format is a plaintext file, which plays nice with version control systems like git.
* Runs entirely in your browser, everything is static: no server, no setup and no build step.

Let's see it in action!

> Tip: Press the ▶ Play button on the left to run a cell's code.

# %%--- [javascript]
# properties:
#   top_hidden: true
# ---%%
// You write vanilla Javascript
const greeting = "Hello world!";

// The last statement in a cell will be displayed if it is not undefined.
greeting
# %% [html]
<div id="my-element" style="background-color: #ddf; padding: 0 1em;">
  <b>You can mix and match different types of cells</b>
</div>
# %% [js]
// Your browser does the work, so stuff like this just works
document.querySelector("#my-element").style.backgroundColor = "#fdf";

const titleElement = document.createElement("h3");
titleElement.innerText = "Great!"

// If you return a HTML element and it will be appended below
titleElement
# %% [js]
// There's a little bit of (optional) magic, if you use `var` your variable will be available globally.
var magic = "I can print this in the next cell!";

// The previous cell's result is available as $_
console.log($_)
# %% [js]
// Poof!
console.log(magic);
# %% [js]
// Everybody makes mistakes
thisVariableDoesNotExist
# %% [js]
// We can import code dynamically, top level await is supported.
const {default: Confetti} = await import(
    'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvas-confetti@0.2.0/dist/confetti.module.mjs'
);

function fireConfetti(event) {
    const x = event.clientX / document.body.clientWidth;
    const y = event.clientY / document.body.clientHeight;
    Confetti({origin: {x, y}});
}

// You can use lit for templating if you want to
html`<button @click=${fireConfetti}>Fire Confetti 🎉</button>`;
# %% [esm]
// There is also an ES module cell type, any variable or function you export is available in the global scope
// In ES Modules you can use top-level imports like you are probably used to
import twas from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/twas"

// This value is now available in any cell as it is exported
export const javascriptInventionDate = Date.parse('04 Dec 1995 00:12:00 GMT')

// The default export gets printed below and used as cell return value
export default "Javascript was invented " + twas(javascriptInventionDate)
# %% [css]
/* The editor itself also runs in the sandbox, you can modify or extend it however you wish as you go.
In the future you will be able to load code that adds new cell types or language support (such as Python).

For now: let's just make the editor a bit more funky by adding some CSS */

.cell-container:focus-within {
    /*background-color: rgb(255, 243, 175);*/
    transition: all ease-in-out 200ms;
}
# %% [js]
// Finally, let's create a tiny API based app in just a few lines: an advice button.
const adviceElement = document.createElement("span");

async function onClick(event) {
    // Example response: {"slip": { "id": 163, "advice": "Big things have small beginnings."}}
    const data = await (await fetch(`https://api.adviceslip.com/advice`, {cache: "no-store"})).json();
    adviceElement.innerText = data.slip.advice;

    // Uncomment to make it fire confetti too
    // fireConfetti(event);
}


html`
<div style="padding: 0.4em 1em; margin: 0 1em; background-color: #fff; border: 1px solid">
    <button @click=${onClick}>Give me advice</button>
    ${adviceElement}
</div>
`

That's it! I hope that both the advice and Starboard are useful for you.
